a. What changed in hello.i compared to hello.c?

In hello.i, the preprocessor has already run. Because of this, the #include <stdio.h> line is replaced by all the code from the standard library header. The defined macro MESSAGE is directly substituted with the string "Hello from CS327" in the program. Also, preprocessing lines like #include and #define are no longer present, and some additional # lines are added to help with debugging and line tracking.

b. How many lines are in hello.s? What do the first 10 lines do?

The assembly file hello.s contains 44 lines in total. The initial lines of the file describe the source file, create separate sections for instructions and read-only data, save the string constant, and then indicate where the main function begins.

c. What is the size difference between hello.o and the final executable hello?

The object file hello.o is much smaller than the final executable hello. The size of hello.o is about 1.7 kB, while the final executable hello is about 16.7 kB. The executable file is larger because it combines the object file with required libraries, startup code, and resolved addresses, which are needed to successfully run the program.
